## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most interesting thing that I learned with this project is creating accordions semantically.
Instead of using JavaScript, I used semantic HTML5 to create the accordion. This included using the following:

```html
<details>
  <summary>My Interesting Stuff</summary>
  <p>Here is some interesting stuff.</p>
</details>
```

Using the details tag allowed for no JavaScript to be used and as well provide with semantic markup for those that use
screen readers.
